🏥 Hospital ER Analytics — Power BI Dashboard

A complete Emergency Room (ER) Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, focusing on patient flow, wait-time efficiency, admission rates, referral patterns, and satisfaction metrics.
This project was developed as part of my internship, and I handled the work end-to-end — from cleaning the data to designing the visuals and developing DAX logic.
